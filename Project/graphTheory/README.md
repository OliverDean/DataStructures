Question 1. Write a method that, given a pair of pages, returns the minimum number of links you must follow to get from the first page to the second. See here for more information.

Question 2. Write a method that finds a Hamiltonian path in a Wikipedia page graph. A Hamiltonian path is any path in some graph that visits every vertex exactly once. This method will never be called for graphs with more than 20 pages. See here for more information about Hamiltonian paths.

Question 3. Write a method that finds every ‘strongly connected component’ of pages. A strongly connected component is a set of vertices such that there is a path between every ordered pair of vertices in the strongly connected component. See here for more information about strongly connected components.

Questions 4. Write a method that finds all the centers of the Wikipedia page graph. A vertex is considered to be the center of a graph if the maximum shortest path from that vertex to any other vertex is the minimum possible. See here for more information about ‘graph center’.
